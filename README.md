This project aims to automatically solve the [Cemantix puzzle](https://cemantix.certitudes.org/) as quickly and efficiently as possible. It also let the user filter his model to fit it own dictionary.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

```bash
# On project root

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üöÄ Solver execution

Without configuration, the solver use default dictionary, filtered by `initialFiltering.py`

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py solve
```

## üßπ Dictionary filtering

To start filtering a new Word2Vec model, follow these steps :
- Change the `model_path` properties in the [configuration file](#-configuration) to point to your new model
- Execute the following, it will take a bit of time, but you can follow the filtering inside of logs (default location : `logs/solver.log`)
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 main.py init &
```

To give you more information, this script applies the following filters :
- Word exists in French dictionary
- Word have more than 1 letters
- Word is not a conjugated verb
- Word is not plural
- Word do not start by non-alphanumeric characters
- Word do not contains non-alphanumeric characters other than "-"
- Word is not inside of previously tested word (listed in `src/ressources/invalid_words.pkl`)

To applies these filter, the script is using this [glossary](http://www.lexique.org/).

## üîß Configuration

Configuration file location : `src/ressources/config.ini`

You can configure a lot this script, but it is advised to use the default configuration.


## Resources
This project use the following resources :

- French glossary : http://www.lexique.org/

The french glossary is used when you want to filter your own model. It is used to know if a word is plural or conjugated.

- Cemantix dictionary (from Jean-Philippe Fauconnier): https://fauconnier.github.io/#data

I've used [this model](https://embeddings.net/embeddings/frWac_non_lem_no_postag_no_phrase_200_cbow_cut100.bin) (bin (120Mb) cbow) with my filtering script to get the current `src/ressources/frWac.bin` file. This file is also filtered everyday by removing all invalid words found when the script is running.
